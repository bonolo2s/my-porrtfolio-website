# My Portfolio website

## Description
This project is a portfolio website.

## Motivation
I wanted to test my knowledge of responsive design and the complexity of using grid box instead of flex box.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Used to manipulate styles that wouldn't be possible to manipulate using the built-in functionalities offered by CSS itself.

## Features
Here are the key features of this project:
1. Responsive navbar
2. Responsive and integrated contact form that sends emails to my inbox
3. CSS grid display
4. Hover effects

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you're interested in contributing, here are some guidelines:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes in your branch.
4. Submit a pull request.

Please note, the only contribution I'm open to is a rebranded style of my portfolio website. Please ensure your code adheres to the existing style for consistency.
